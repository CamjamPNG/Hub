# ReductV3
New version of Reduct, a Revolt.chat client held together by duct tape and bad code.
Adds websockets, more features, more code, still no libraries, tries to minimise amount of requests sent to the API.
As this is a personal project to learn through doing, I don't intend to accept pull requests - send issues instead, or if it's something I don't see fitting or over my capabilities, feel free to fork this.
